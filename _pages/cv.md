## Research Direction
My research investigates the **formalization of compositional reasoning** through representation geometry. I study how **algebraic and geometric inductive biases**—such as associativity, identity, and compositional refinement—can be treated as differentiable, **adaptive inductive priors** within neural representations. My goal is to move beyond scale-driven progress toward a theory of how **representation form** shapes reasoning capability, enabling robust **out-of-distribution compositional extrapolation**.

## Research Interests
*   **Adaptive Inductive Priors**: Differentiable constraints for structural regularity.
*   **Geometric Deep Learning**: Lie-theoretic perspectives on iterative neural refinement.
*   **Functorial Semantics**: Learned homomorphism and equivariance in latent spaces.
*   **Systematic Generalization**: Extrapolating to unseen multi-step and hierarchical compositions.

## Research Experience
*   **Latent Program Networks (LPNs)**
    *   Introduced a framework for structuring latent transformations using algebraic constraints (**Associativity, Identity, Closure**).
    *   Demonstrated **systematic multi-step generalization** from single-step supervision without explicit symbolic rules or test-time search.
    *   Established that complex reasoning emerges when latent geometry is appropriately shaped, rather than through scale alone.
*   **G42 Group, Abu Dhabi**
    *   Designed and built an AI prototype for a **sovereign wealth fund**.
    *   Integrated LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agentic workflows to automate reasoning in fixed-income research and investment workflows.
*   **Agentic Reasoning Systems**
    *   Investigated modular, state-driven architectures in which multiple language-model-based agents interact through structured routing, uncertainty assessment, and hierarchical control.
    *   Reframed reasoning as an emergent process arising from coordination, persistence, and selective refinement across agents rather than a monolithic forward pass.
*   **Double Machine Learning (Causal Inference)**
    *   Studied how **orthogonalization and structural constraints** enable reliable causal reasoning in high-dimensional settings where naïve predictive learning fails.
    *   Reinforced a unifying research insight: **robust reasoning depends on the explicit structure imposed on representations and inference pathways**, independent of model scale.
